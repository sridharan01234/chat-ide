### Ghost Chat Usage

**Ghost Chat** is a revolutionary feature that brings AI assistance directly to your cursor position, similar to modern editors like Cursor.

#### Quick Start

1. **Position your cursor** where you want assistance
2. **Press `Ctrl+K`** (or `Cmd+K` on Mac)
3. **Type your request** (e.g., "add error handling")
4. **Press `Enter`** to send to AI
5. **Review the preview** (shown as diff-style overlay)
6. **Press `Tab` to accept** or **`Escape` to reject**

#### Example Workflow

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
    // Place cursor here and press Ctrl+K
    // Type: "Add error handling"
    // AI will show suggestion as preview overlay
    const response = fetch(url);
    return response.json();
}
```

After typing your request and pressing Enter, you'll see a diff-style preview of the suggested changes. The preview uses VS Code's diff editor colors to clearly show what would be added or modified.

#### Ghost Chat Features

- **No Direct Changes**: See suggestions before they're applied
- **Context Aware**: Includes surrounding code for better suggestions
- **Multi-line Support**: Handles complex code transformations
- **Keyboard Driven**: Complete workflow using only keyboard
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear preview with accept/reject buttons

#### Best Practices

- **Be specific**: "Add null checks" vs "fix this"
- **Use selection**: Select code first for targeted changes
- **Review carefully**: Always check suggestions before accepting
- **Context matters**: Position cursor appropriately for best results

1. **Detects Language** - Based on file extension and content
2. **Extracts Functions** - Identifies all function definitions
3. **Finds Classes** - Locates class and interface declarations
4. **Analyzes Imports** - Maps dependencies and modules
5. **Generates Summary** - Provides file statistics and insights

### Advanced Drag & Drop

The extension handles multiple drag sources:

- **VS Code Explorer files** - Standard file tree navigation
- **Editor tabs** - Direct from open file tabs
- **External files** - From OS file managers (limited to 1MB)
- **Folders** - Processes all contained files (up to 10 files)

### Smart Response Generation

The AI assistant provides contextual responses based on:

- **File content** - Analyzes code structure and patterns
- **User questions** - Tailors responses to specific queries
- **Code context** - Understands relationships between files
- **Best practices** - Suggests improvements and optimizations

## 🛠️ Configuration

### File Processing Limits

- **Maximum file size**: 1MB for external files
- **Folder processing**: Up to 10 files per folder
- **Supported encodings**: UTF-8 text files

### Performance Optimization

The extension is optimized for:

- **Memory efficiency** - Caches DOM elements and processes files incrementally
- **Fast response times** - Asynchronous file processing
- **Minimal resource usage** - Efficient event handling and cleanup

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Files Not Attaching

**Problem**: Drag and drop doesn't work
**Solutions**:

- Ensure files are under 1MB (for external files)
- Try using the file browser button instead
- Check VS Code Developer Console for errors

#### Chat Interface Not Loading

**Problem**: Webview shows error or doesn't appear
**Solutions**:

- Reload VS Code window (`Ctrl+R`)
- Check that all webview files exist in the extension
- Use Command Palette to open chat

#### Extension Not Activating

**Problem**: Robot icon doesn't appear in Activity Bar
**Solutions**:

- Ensure extension is properly compiled (`npm run compile`)
- Check for TypeScript compilation errors
- Restart VS Code

### Debug Mode

1. **Open Developer Tools**

   - Help → Toggle Developer Tools
   - Check Console tab for extension logs

2. **Enable Verbose Logging**

   - Look for messages prefixed with `[Extension]`, `[ChatProvider]`, or `[Webview]`

3. **Common Log Messages**
   ```
   [Extension] Activating AI Code Assistant...
   [ChatProvider] Processing dropped file: filename.js
   [Webview] Drop event triggered
   ```
