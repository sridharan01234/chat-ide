### Available Commands

| Command | Shortcut | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `AI Assistant: Open Chat` | `Ctrl+Shift+A` | Open main chat interface |
| `AI Assistant: Start Ghost Chat` | `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K`) | Start cursor-positioned AI chat |
| `AI Assistant: Accept Ghost Chat` | `Tab` | Accept AI suggestion (when active) |
| `AI Assistant: Reject Ghost Chat` | `Escape` | Reject AI suggestion (when active) |
| `AI Assistant: Attach Active File` | - | Attach currently open file |
| `AI Assistant: Browse Files` | - | Open file picker |

### Ghost Chat Usage

**Ghost Chat** is a revolutionary feature that brings AI assistance directly to your cursor position, similar to modern editors like Cursor.

#### Quick Start

1. **Position your cursor** where you want assistance
2. **Press `Ctrl+K`** (or `Cmd+K` on Mac)
3. **Type your request** (e.g., "add error handling")
4. **Press `Enter`** to send to AI
5. **Review the preview** (shown as diff-style overlay)
6. **Press `Tab` to accept** or **`Escape` to reject**

#### Example Workflow

```javascript
function fetchData(url) {
    // Place cursor here and press Ctrl+K
    // Type: "Add error handling"
    // AI will show suggestion as preview overlay
    const response = fetch(url);
    return response.json();
}
```

After typing your request and pressing Enter, you'll see a diff-style preview of the suggested changes. The preview uses VS Code's diff editor colors to clearly show what would be added or modified.

#### Ghost Chat Features

- **No Direct Changes**: See suggestions before they're applied
- **Context Aware**: Includes surrounding code for better suggestions
- **Multi-line Support**: Handles complex code transformations
- **Keyboard Driven**: Complete workflow using only keyboard
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear preview with accept/reject buttons

#### Best Practices

- **Be specific**: "Add null checks" vs "fix this"
- **Use selection**: Select code first for targeted changes
- **Review carefully**: Always check suggestions before accepting
- **Context matters**: Position cursor appropriately for best results

Access via Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- `AI Assistant: Open Chat` - Open the chat interface
- `AI Assistant: Attach Active File` - Attach currently open file
- `AI Assistant: Attach Selection` - Attach selected code
